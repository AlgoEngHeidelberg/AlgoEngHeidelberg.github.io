Our group tackles a broad spectrum of scalable graph algorithms in particular in the context of very large inputs. In general, our research is based on five pillars: multilevel algorithms, practical kernelization, parallelization, memetic algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms that are highly interconnected.
To this end, our group engineers algorithms that
improve known methods.
Typically, we release the techniques and algorithms developed as easy-to-use open source software.  
Examples include a
widely used library of algorithms for graph
partitioning, graph drawing,
(weighted) independent sets, hypergraph partitioning, graph clustering, graph generation, minimum cuts, process mapping and many more.
